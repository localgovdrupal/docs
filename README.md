# LocalGovDrupal Docs

The repository for the documentation sitting at https://docs.localgovdrupal.org/

## Local development

1. Start lando

2. Change directory to `docs`

3. `lando yarn install` to install dependencies

4. `lando yarn dev` to start a dev server

## Adding images

You can add your images to the `images` folder next to the other folders and then you can reference these by using `![Alt text here](../images/image.png)`.

## Known issues

Occasionally when making changes vuepress will not reload, so you have to restart the compiler.
