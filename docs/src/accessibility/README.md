# Accessibility
It is a primary goal of the project to ensure that the LocalGov Drupal modules and themes are accessible to all users.

This documentation provides guidance for developers, and a recommended process for testing accessibility.

## Applicable guidelines
The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

### Target conformance level
All public facing content and functionality should meet or exceed WCAG 2.2 level AA.

The project also has a target for the administration interface to meet or exceed level AA, but accepts this may not be feasible for some time.

While the default installation of LocalGov Drupal will have been tested and assured to meet the appropriate standards, it is still possible to create inaccessible content and websites with the distribution. It is the responsibility of site owners to maintain accessibility in content, sub-themes, and any other extensions of the distribution.

## Quality assurance
Accessibility is the responsibility of all contributors:
- All development should be carried out with accessibility in mind.
- An accessibility review should be carried out for any release featuring new or amended functionality.
- If you need help please raise an issue on Github in the relevant issue queue.
