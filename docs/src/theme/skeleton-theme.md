# Skeleton theme

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_skeleton)

The base theme we encourage you to use to build upon. The theme offers no styling or javascript functionality whatsoever and only contains twig templates.

The base theme it's based on is `classy` and it sets up several regions you might need and are used in our frontend theme. 

There are currently no preprocess hooks written.
