# How to set character limits

Our new character limits feature provides the following:

* setting the number of characters in the title and summary fields 
* setting the content formats the limits apply to
* a display showing the number of characters remaining (it's not a hard limit, you can go over it if you wish)

This is an optional part of LGD, so please ask your developer to [install it](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/releases/tag/3.1.2).


## How to use it

* Once installed, go to Configuration > LocalGov character counter (or /admin/config/content/localgov-char-count on your site)
* Edit the title length and summary length fields as you wish
* Scroll down and select the fields you would like the limits to apply to
* Click 'Apply configuration changes' at the foot of the page when you're done

On content formats where the limits are enabled, you'll see a display like this.

It's possible to edit how this information is displayed - go back to the config page to change it.
