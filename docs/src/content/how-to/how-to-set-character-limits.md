# How to set character limits

The [Textfield Counter](https://www.drupal.org/project/textfield_counter) module provides the following features:

* setting the number of characters in the title and summary fields 
* setting the content formats the limits apply to
* a display showing the number of characters remaining (it's not a hard limit, you can go over it if you wish)

This module is included in LocalGov Drupal, but is not switched on. Talk to your developer about enabling it.

## How to use it

* Once installed, go to Configuration > LocalGov character counter (or /admin/config/content/localgov-char-count on your site)
* Edit the title length and summary length fields as you wish
* Scroll down and select the fields you would like the limits to apply to
* Click 'Apply configuration changes' at the foot of the page when you're done

On content formats where the limits are enabled, you'll see a display like this.

It's possible to edit how this information is displayed - go back to the config page to change it.
