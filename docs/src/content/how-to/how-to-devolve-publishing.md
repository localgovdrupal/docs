# How to devolve publishing to other teams

The [Content access by path](https://www.drupal.org/project/content_access_by_path) module allows you to set viewing and editing restrictions to a set of URLs or paths. For example, you can allow a group of users to edit all content inside _/news_ or inside _/news/sports_ or inside _/news/sports/rugby_.

As well as being able to edit content within those allowed paths, editors will also be able to edit content they are the author of.

This video shows how it works.
