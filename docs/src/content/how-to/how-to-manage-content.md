## View your content

See all the content you have permission to view and edit:

* Either click **Admin menu > Content**
* Or visit **yourdomain.gov.uk/admin/content**

This screen defaults to showing the 'Content overview' tab. Depending on your permissions, you may also be able to see the following tabs:

* Blocks
* Media
* Alert banners
* Directory facets
* Locations
* Page components
* Scheduling

The 'Content overview' tab shows a list of content and its metadata (for example content type, author, status and last updated date).

You can search and filter the list. An Edit button will appear by the content you have permission to edit.
