# How to migrate content from existing sites

There is a wealth of experience in our community about migrating content from existing sites to LocalGov Drupal. We'll add links and tips to this page over time. If you have tips please [improve this page](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/docs/edit/main/docs/src/content/how-to/how-to-migrate-content-from-existing-sites.md) or message us on Slack.

## Types of migration

Over 60 organisations have migrated content to LocalGov Drupal and we have seen three common approaches:

* Manual migrations led by content designers
* Automatic migrations led by developers
* A combination of both, depending on time available and the importance of the content
