To use them you need [LocalGov Workflow](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_workflows) which is included in LocalGov Drupal, but not switched on. Talk to your developer about enabling it.

## How to use

Please see this video guide by content designer Ben Hills-Jones.

### Checking if Workflow is enabled

There's an easy way to check if Workflow is enabled on your site. If you see a'Published' toggle and a 'Save' button, Workflow is not enabled.
