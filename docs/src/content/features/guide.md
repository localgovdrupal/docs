## When to use Guides

Guide pages are useful when you want to group together a collection of connected pages. If there's content that's relative to the user completing a task, but it doesn't follow a strict process, you should use the guide format. 

They are useful if you want to give someone a range of information on one subject. The user can use the 'Next' button to move through the guide. However, they do not need to read every page in order, like in a [step by step](/content/features/step-by-step.html).

Examples include:

* types of animal welfare licences
* changing a birth record
* coroners
* sheltered housing
