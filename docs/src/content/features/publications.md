# Publications

The LocalGov Publications module is on Github here:

[https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_publications](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_publications)

This module provides publication content types and configuration for the
LocalGov Drupal distribution.

The intention is to encourage councils to publish publications in a more
accessible and responsive HTML format rather than in PDF files.

We use Drupal's book module to provide navigation between hierarchically related
pages of a publication.

It is also possible to create a single page publication with inline navigation
between headings.


## Using Localgov Publications

See the video below for a demonstration of how to manage publication content.

## How to use publications

You need to be logged in as the editor role. 

1. You need to create a new publication page - call it the name of your publication. 
2. click Publication outline and then it'll say create a new publication
3. Then when you create the second page "Part 1" make sure you select the same publication from the sidebar


## Reordering pages 

The table of contents will reflect the pages added to the publication and if you need to change the order you can do so by going to Structure > Publications > 'your publication' and dragging titles around like you do with menus


## Publication cover page

A publication cover page is an optional cover (think of it as a book jacket) where other versions of the same publication can live) - it's best to make this after you've made the first page of your publication (edited) 


## Blocks not showing? 

If you don’t have a menu in the sidebar after installing you need to place two blocks. 
1. **Publications Table of Contents** for the automatic h2 menu 
2. **Publications navigation** for all of the pages in the book.

Place both into the sidebar of choice (sidebar first) and hide or rename the title for each block and ensure the content type settings are set to the publication content type. 


## Example publications in the wild
