# Publications

The LocalGov Publications module is on Github here:

[https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_publications](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_publications)

This module provides publication content types and configuration for the
LocalGov Drupal distribution.

The intention is to encourage councils to publish publications in a more
accessible and responsive HTML format rather than in PDF files.

We use Drupal's book module to provide navigation between hierarchically related
pages of a publication.

It is also possible to create a single page publication with inline navigation
between headings.

## Using Localgov Publications

See the video below for a demonstration of how to manage publication content.
