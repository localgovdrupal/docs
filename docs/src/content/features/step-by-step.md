## When to use step by step pages

Step by step pages are useful where the user has to follow a process. This could include:

* registering for something
* applying for something
* renewing something
* resetting a password

Examples could be registering for a civil partnership, registering a death or help signing in to My Account.

## Editing tips

### On step by step landing pages

Avoid having too much copy on step by step landing pages, as it pushes the steps further down the page making them hard to find, especially on mobile devices.

Include no more than 3 to 4 sentences, or an alert box â€“ if there is something you need to warn users about or there's information that is out of the usual way of doing things.

## On step by step titles

It's good practice to include 'step by step' in the title of your page. This makes it clear to the user that this is a process to follow.
