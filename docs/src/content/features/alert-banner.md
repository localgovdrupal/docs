# Alert banners

Alert banners are a good way of sharing urgent information across your whole site, or a selection of pages. 

If you want to share something less important about a specific service, it's worth trying [Service status](https://docs.localgovdrupal.org/content/features/services.html#service-status) instead.

## How to use
