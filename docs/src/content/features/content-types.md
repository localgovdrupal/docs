# Content types

A LocalGov Drupal site will typically have a number of different [content types](/content/#drupal-terminology), each suited to a particular purpose.

This page gives an overview of these different types. Note that not all content types may be available on your site, depending on which LocalGov Drupal modules have been installed.
