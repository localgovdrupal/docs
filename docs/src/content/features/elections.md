# Elections

The [elections module](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_elections) provides the following features:

* First past the post single seat per electoral area elections
* 'All-out' and not 'all-out' (e.g. halves or thirds) elections
* Table, graph and map based views of the results
* Extensible boundary source provider for electoral areas and geo data
* Social media posting of results (currently Twitter / X)

See detailed [installation instructions](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_elections/blob/1.x/README.md) and a [step by step guide to setting up elections](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_elections/blob/1.x/docs/index.md).
