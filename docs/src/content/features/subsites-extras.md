# Subsites extras 

## When to use

This module allows you to create menu-driven subsites in your LGD site. This is an optional part of LGD, so please ask your developer to [install it](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_subsites_extras).

The menu defines the structure of the subsite, and also lets you use Drupal's standard menu blocks and tools to display the subsite's navigation and manage the hierarchy of the pages within it.
