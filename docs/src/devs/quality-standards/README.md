# Quality standards for LocalGov Drupal projects

[[toc]]

We want to ensure that our projects meet high standards of quality, including
code, documentation, testing and more.

Drupal core identifies a [number of key "gates"](https://www.drupal.org/about/core/policies/core-change-policies/core-gates) that must be passed before a module is
accepted into the Drupal core codebase.

We aim to do the same for LocalGov Drupal. This policy is meant to be a
checklist and guide for project maintainers to make sure the project meets the
standards our users have come to expect and rely upon.
