# Quality standard: Documentation 

Let's make the documentation great for developers and content designers alike.

Before recommending a project for use with LocalGov Drupal, project maintainers
should confirm the following.

## 1. README.md file for projects / modules

Where applicable, a README.md file is in the root of the project or module.

 - Project name and introduction (required)
 - Table of contents (optional)
 - Requirements (required)
 - Recommended modules (optional)
 - Installation (required, unless a separate INSTALL.md is provided)
 - Configuration (required)
 - Troubleshooting & FAQ (optional)
 - Maintainers (optional)

For further reference, please see [README.md template guidelines on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/managing-a-drupalorg-theme-module-or-distribution-project/documenting-your-project/readmemd-template)
