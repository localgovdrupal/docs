# Security

The security of your LocalGov Drupal website should be given due consideration before launch.

Keeping abreast of Drupal security advisories is important. See [https://www.drupal.org/security]([url](https://www.drupal.org/security)) 

To subscribe to Drupal security emails: log in to Drupal.org, go to your user profile page and subscribe to the security newsletter on the Edit Â» My newsletters tab.

There are also a number of Drupal modules and best practice configurations to help increase the security of your Drupal site.
