# Release statuses

LocalGov Drupal projects aim to follow a fairly standard approach to releases.

This includes the Localgov Drupal distribution and optional contributed modules.

## Alpha releases

An alpha release signifies that we are getting closer to a stable releaes, but
is potentially unstable and needs more testing to flush out bugs.

For example, [3.0.0-alpha1](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/releases/tag/3.0.0-alpha1)

## Beta releases

The beta relase is considered more stable, with

- critical data loss and security bugs are resolved
- functionality, APIs and dependencies are stable enough for others to rely on
- most problems with upgrade paths are fixed

For example, [4.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_microsites/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta1)

## Release candidates

At times, we might make a release candidate for further testing before a stable
releases.

For example, 4.0.0-rc1

(Note, we've not actually made any release candidates.)

## Stable release

A stable release is considered stable, secure, performant and is aligned with
our quality standards.

For example, [3.0.4](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/releases/tag/3.0.4)
