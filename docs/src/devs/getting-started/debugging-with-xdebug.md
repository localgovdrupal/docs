# Debugging with Xdebug

[Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) is an extension for PHP, and provides a range of
features to improve the PHP development experience. The setup can depend on your
local development environment and which IDE you are using.

## Lando, Xdebug and VSCODE
Xdebug can have a signifant performance hit on PHP requests, so by default we
usually run local development enviroments without Xdebug enabled.

Here are steps to get debugging in Lando.

1. Enable xdebug with a local Lando file.

The .lando.local.yml can override any of the settings defined in the default
`.lando.dist.yml` that we include with the LocalGov Drupal project.

If you don't already have one, create a `.lando.local.yml` in the root of your
project and make sure it contains the following:

``` bash
config:
  xdebug: true
```

2. Rebuild lando

```
lando rebuild -y
```

3. In VSCode, enable the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug)

4. Click on the Run and Debug icon to set the configuration.

5. Cick 'create a launch.json file'

6. Add the following to the launch.json file

```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9003,
      "log": true,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/app": "${workspaceFolder}/MY_PROJECT",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the path mapping might depend on where you workspace root is.
In this example, I have a VSCODE workspace at .~/sites/l.localgov into which I
have created the project in the MY_PROJECT folder. Lando runs from within the
MY_PROJECT folder, so it maps that folder to /app from within the appserver
container.

7. Press the Start Debugging icon to start listening for Xdebug

8. Add a breakpoint to your index.php file by clicking to the left of the line numbers of a line with code on.

9. Load the home page of the site

10. See the script break and provide you with variables and callstack.

## DDEV, Xdebug and VSCODE

Xdebug can have a signifant performance hit on PHP requests, so by default we
usually run local development enviroments without Xdebug enabled.

1. Enable XDebug with DDEV, assuming a default DDEV Drupal configuration:

``` bash
ddev xdebug
```

2. In VSCode, enable the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug)

3. Click on the Run and Debug icon to set the configuration.
4. Cick 'create a launch.json file'

5. Add the following to the launch.json file

```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9003,
      "log": true,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}/MY_PROJECT",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the path mapping might depend on where you workspace root is.
In this example, I have a workspace into which I have created the project into the MY_PROJECT folder.
DDEV runs from within the MY_PROJECT folder, so it maps that folder to /var/www/html

4. Press the Start Debugging icon to start listening for Xdebug
