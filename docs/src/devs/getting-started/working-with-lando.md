# Working with Lando

## Lando Installation

Lando is a free, Open Source, cross-platform, local development environment and DevOps tool built on Docker container
technology. Lando basically allows you to mimic a Cloud-hosting environment locally - it's like having a server on your 
laptop. On a high level, your lando configuration should contain ALL the things you need to run, develop and test your 
project.

To install Lando, follow the steps outlined on the 
[official Lando installation page](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.html).

## LocalGov Drupal local installation, with Composer and Lando

If you haven't yet installed Composer and Docker Desktop, see [Getting Started](/devs/getting-started/) for instructions 
on how to install these requirements.

Now that we have all the required dependencies in place (Composer, Docker Desktop and Lando), we can create our first 
LocalGov Drupal project locally.

Open your Terminal / Command Prompt and switch to an appropriate directory (for example, on Mac OS X, the ~/Sites
folder is commonly preferred):

```bash
cd ~/Sites 
```

We are going to use the LGD project template publicly available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_project](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_project).

To build the LGD project locally, we need to run the following Composer command and bring all the required packages
together in a new LGD_DEMO directory (feel free to change the project name to anything else you might prefer):

```bash
composer create-project localgovdrupal/localgov-project LGD_DEMO --no-install
```

The Terminal output of this command will look something like the following:

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer command output ](../../images/LGD-Composer-project-build-terminal-output.png)

Switch to the LGD_DEMO directory by running:

```bash
cd LGD_DEMO
```

Then, fire up Lando:

```bash
lando start
```

The Terminal output of this command will look something like the following:

![ LocalGov Drupal: Lando start command output ](../../images/LGD-lando-start-1.png)

When the process of building Lando is complete, a list of useful details is presented, including the services installed
in the corresponding Docker containers as well as their corresponding URLs:

![ LocalGov Drupal: Lando start command output end ](../../images/LGD-lando-start-2.png)

The Docker dashboard, with all our LGD demo project's containers up and running, should look something like the
following - keep in mind that some variations are possible due to Operating System differences or even Mac chip
variants (Intel / Silicon):

![ Lando start: LocalGov Drupal containers ](../../images/LGD-lando-start-complete-docker-containers.png)

Now it's time to bring in all the Composer packages for this project (this can take a while as the command downloads 
all the necessary packages from their corresponding repositories). As you might be running a different version of PHP 
on your host machine from the version that Lando runs, it is advisable to run `composer install` from within Lando. 
This ensures dependencies reflect the PHP version that the webserver is actually running:

```bash
lando composer install
```

Below, we are presenting the main phases of the `lando composer install` process (you can read more about how Composer 
actually manages and installs dependencies on the 
[corresponding Composer documentation page](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#installing-dependencies)).

### 1. Locking dependencies to their defined versions

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer install output - 1 ](../../images/LGD-lando-composer-install-1.png)

### 2. Downloading the locked dependencies

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer install output - 2 ](../../images/LGD-lando-composer-install-2.png)

### 3. Installing the downloaded dependencies

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer install output - 3 ](../../images/LGD-lando-composer-install-3.png)

### 4. Applying patches

(These have also been pre-defined in the LGD Composer template.)

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer install output - 4 ](../../images/LGD-lando-composer-install-4.png)

### 5. Scaffolding files

(Scaffolding is a fancy name for putting certain key Drupal files and their contents in place).

![ LocalGov Drupal: Composer install output - 5 ](../../images/LGD-lando-composer-install-5.png)

### Site Installation with Drush

After the `composer install` process has been completed, we can finally install our LGD site locally using the
`drush site install` command (for more on drush, Drupal's magic scripting tool, see 
[https://www.drush.org](https://www.drush.org)):

```bash
lando drush si localgov -y
```

The output of the command will look something like the following:

![ LocalGov Drupal: drush site install output ](../../images/LGD-lando-drush-site-install.png)

Believe it or not, our new LocalGov Drupal site is ready! Remember those APPSERVER URLs returned by lando start above?
You can use any of them, and the returned credentials from the last command, to access your Drupal administrator
account on your brand new LGD site on your favourite browser:

![ LocalGov Drupal: Demo site user login page ](../../images/LGD-demo-site-user-login-page.png)

Logging into your admin account lands you on the Drupal content page:

![ LocalGov Drupal: Demo site admin area ](../../images/LGD-demo-site-admin-logged-in.png)

Your new LocalGov Drupal site is now up and running locally.
From here, you can explore all the beautiful features LGD offers, such as content types, components and many more!

## Additional Composer notes

If developing locally and you want to force composer to clone again
from source rather than use composer cache, you can add the `--no-cache` flag.

```bash
lando composer create-project localgovdrupal/localgov-project MY_PROJECT --stability dev --no-cache  --no-install 
```

If you just want to pull in the latest changes to LocalGov Drupal run composer
update with the `--no-cache` flag.

```bash
lando composer update --no-cache
```

If you want to be sure you are getting the latest commits when developing,
clearing composer cache, deleting the folders and re-running composer update
seems to be a solid approach:

```bash

rm -rf web/profiles/contrib/ web/modules/contrib/ web/themes/contrib/;
composer clear-cache; composer update --with-dependencies --no-cache;
lando start;
lando drush si localgov -y;

```

If you run into [memory limit errors](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#memory-limit-errors)
when running Composer commands, prefix the commands with `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1`.
For example, to install the project run:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project --stability dev localgovdrupal/localgov-project MY_PROJECT
```

In the main project we've provided a `.lando.dist.yml` file out of the box to make it easier to get started with the local development setup. Of course, you are free to use other alternatives to Lando (such as DDEV - please see [here](working-with-ddev.md)).

If you've never used Lando before you should read the [basics](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/); essentially it is a wrapper around Docker providing a much more simplified setup.

## Usage

Assuming you've installed Lando and have it setup, the commands you will commonly use are

`lando start` - starts up the project from the `.lando.yml` file, if it's the first time it will pull the images and build the project

`lando stop` - halts the project

`lando help` - provides a full list of available commands, including custom commands

`lando db-import file.sql` - imports a database file, accepts gzipped databases

`lando drush` - custom command to run drush commands inside the appserver container

`lando npm` - custom command to run npm inside the node container

For a full list you can visit the [official documentation](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/usage.html).

Lando also has [several guides](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-101/lando-overview.html) for How-Tos, including using it with [PhpStorm](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-phpstorm.html), [VSCode](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-with-vscode.html) and [working with PHP](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/installing-php-extensions-on-lando.html).

## Configuration

If your project contains a `.lando.dist.yml` it's meant for that file to be overrideable. In fact you can have multiple layers of configuration so that you can [override](https://docs.lando.dev/config/lando.html#base-file) them with your own config for local development for example.

If you're looking for more configuration options the Lando docs are the best place to find them, here's a useful list:

- [Tooling](https://docs.lando.dev/config/tooling.html) (aka custom commands)

- [Proxying](https://docs.lando.dev/config/proxy.html)

- [Environment](https://docs.lando.dev/config/env.html)

## Extending

In your `.lando.yml` you can continue adding other services for any Python, Solr, Node or database containers your project will need in addition to the defaults. Most Drupal installations are setup with a [recipe](https://docs.lando.dev/config/recipes.html) that simply provides some sensible defaults, but you also have a full list of [services](https://docs.lando.dev/config/services.html#supported-services) you can add. Of course you can also add specific images.

## Coding standards

PHP CodeSniffer is installed as a dev dependency by Composer and configured to
use Drupal coding standards and best practices. It is a good idea to run these
before committing any code. All code in pull requests should pass all
CodeSniffer tests.

To check code using Lando run:

```bash
lando phpcs
```

To attempt to automatically fix coding errors in Lando run:

```bash
lando phix
```

## Running tests

The included `phpunit.xml.dist` file contains configuration for automatically
running the LocalGov Drupal test suite.

To run all LocalGov Drupal tests with Lando use:

```bash
lando phpunit
```

To run all the tests for a specific module use:

```bash
lando phpunit web/modules/contrib/localgov_my_module
```

Tests can be filtered using the `--filter` option. To only run a specific test
use:

```bash
lando phpunit --filter=myTestName
```
